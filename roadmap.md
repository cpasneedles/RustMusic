## RustMusic Roadmap - 1 Week By GPT 3.5

### Week 1

#### Day 1-2: Integrating Discogs API

- **Task 1**: Study the Discogs API documentation to understand how to fetch track information.
- **Task 2**: Set up the necessary API keys and credentials for accessing the Discogs API.
- **Task 3**: Create a new module or file for handling the Discogs API integration.
- **Task 4**: Implement API requests to retrieve track data based on the provided artist and album information.
- **Task 5**: Integrate the fetched data into your existing data structures (e.g., `TrackData`, `AlbumData`, `ArtistData`).

#### Day 3-4: Integrating Acoustid API

- **Task 1**: Explore the Acoustid API documentation to learn how to use the audio fingerprinting service.
- **Task 2**: Obtain the necessary API keys and credentials for accessing the Acoustid API.
- **Task 3**: Create a new module or file specifically for Acoustid integration.
- **Task 4**: Implement audio fingerprinting logic to identify tracks without metadata.
- **Task 5**: Integrate the retrieved metadata into your existing data structures.

#### Day 5-6: Client Interface Improvements

- **Task 1**: Review and refactor the existing client interface design for better user experience.
- **Task 2**: Enhance the display of track information, including metadata and cover art.
- **Task 3**: Ensure smooth navigation and interaction within the application.
- **Task 4**: Implement basic playback controls (play, pause, next, previous).
- **Task 5**: Test the updated interface to ensure usability and responsiveness.

#### Day 7: Automatic Music Download

- **Task 1**: Research available APIs or libraries that allow automated music downloads.
- **Task 2**: Decide on the most suitable method for implementing automatic music downloads.
- **Task 3**: Develop a feature that enables users to add tracks to their favorites list.
- **Task 4**: Integrate the chosen download mechanism to fetch and save favorite tracks.
- **Task 5**: Test the automatic music download functionality to ensure it works as expected.

### Conclusion

By following this roadmap over the course of one week, you'll be able to enhance your RustMusic app significantly. Keep in mind that this timeline is approximate and may vary based on your familiarity with the technologies and the complexity of the tasks. Regular testing, documentation, and user feedback are essential for creating a successful and user-friendly music player application. Good luck with your project!
